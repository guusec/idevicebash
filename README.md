# idevicebash
libimobiledevice packages for debian/arch based distros don't install tools like idevicebtlogger, etc.<br>
<br>
this script builds the versions of the utils that do have those extra commands.<br>
<br>
tested on arch and ubuntu (if arch, make sure you have yay or paru).<br>
<br>
also included a ble logging profile for iphone/ipad for convenience.<br>
